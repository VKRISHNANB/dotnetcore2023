The management of the LearnMore University is planning to automate the student management system. 
The University offers various curriculums to the students across the globe.
Therefore, Steve Wilkinson, the programmer, has decided to create a Dotnet application.
In the application, Steve needs to store student details, such as ID, name, date of birth, blood group, height, and marks details of the students. 
As a future proposal for the automated system, the management wants to extend the system to manage its employee details too. 
To provide medical benefits to the employees, the system needs to store the blood group and the height of the employee. 
The application should accept student ID and name of the student as command-line parameters and display the student details. 
Help Steve to develop the proposed application.
