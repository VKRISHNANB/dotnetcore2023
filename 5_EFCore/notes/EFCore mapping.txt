One to One
	Note:
	If both the classes in the 1-1 relationship have Navigation properties but,
	do not have the foreignkeys then EFCore will not know which is the Principle and which is the dependent . So we have to provide modelBuilder.Entity<..>HasOne(..).WithOne(..).IsRequired() in the OnModelCreating(..) of the DBContext
	
	Add a new dependent row directly to the table by passing just the principles ID
Shadow properties for database
	1.What are Shadow Properties?
	Shadow properties are most often used for foreign key properties, where the relationship between two entities is represented by a foreign key value in the database, but the relationship is managed on the entity types using navigation properties between the entity types. 
	By convention, EF will introduce a shadow property when a relationship is discovered but no foreign key property is found in the dependent entity class.
	2. Define Shadow properties in mappings
	3. Populate Shadow properties
	4. Use or retrieve shadow properties in queries
	5. Real-world use
	
Owned types for complex types and value objects
