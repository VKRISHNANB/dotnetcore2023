```Challenges  ```

    Challenge #1: How to define the boundaries of each microservice  

        The way you identify boundaries between multiple application contexts with a different domain for each context is exactly how you can identify the boundaries for each business microservice and its related domain model and data. 
        You always attempt to minimize the coupling between those microservices.

    Challenge #2: How to create queries that retrieve data from several microservices  
        API Gateway  
        CQRS  - Command and Query Responsibility Segregation
        “Cold data” in central databases  
        
    Challenge #3: How to achieve consistency across multiple microservices  
    Challenge #4: How to design communication across microservice boundaries
