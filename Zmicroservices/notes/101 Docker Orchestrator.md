Orchestrator: 
---
A tool that simplifies management of clusters and Docker hosts. 

Orchestrators enable you to manage their images, containers, and hosts through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI.

You can manage container networking, configurations, load balancing, service discovery, high availability, Docker host configuration, and more. 

An orchestrator is responsible for running, distributing, scaling, and healing workloads across a collection of nodes. 

Typically, orchestrator products are the same products that provide cluster infrastructure, like Kubernetes and Azure Service Fabric, among other offerings in the market.
